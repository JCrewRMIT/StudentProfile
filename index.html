				<h2>So why study IT?</h2>
			</header>
			
				<section>
					<h3>What is your background in IT?</h3>
					<p>My interesting in IT has been developing from a love of video games and technology. </br> 
				When I was 11 my parents gave my brother and I an Xbox 360 for Christmas. </br> From 
						that day forward my love of video games blossomed and from that I got into gaming 
						setups and computers. </br> The first day of summer holidays for the next few years I 
						would take the xbox into my room and spend an entire day rigging up my tv, chair, 
						desk, laptop and trying to emulate my favourite youtuber setups.</br>  Straight after 
						school I went into a music degree thinking that was what I wanted to do for the 
						rest of my life but after a year, although I loved it, I thought that a degree 
						in music is somewhat pointless. Since then I found a passion for live streaming.</br> 
						Although the market is heavily saturated these days, I feel as though the community
						I’ve built over the last 6 months is just the beginning of what I really want to
						achieve in life. </br> Streaming is swiftly enrapturing my heart but, in saying that, 
						ensuring I have career options if/when I can’t chase down the streaming dream is essential. </p>
		
				</section>
				<section>
					<h3>Why RMIT?</h3>
					<p>Being born and raised in Brisbane, RMIT was not my first choice fresh out of high school. </br> 
						For the past 3 years I’ve been going to QUT which I got into via music audition.</br> 
						My decision to move to Melbourne is wholly due to the fact that the IT industry 
						is significantly bigger down here. </br> My aim is to source some form of work experience
						while in Melbourne and take the experience back to Brisbane to complete my degree and find a job.</p>
				</section>
				
				
				<section>
					<h3>What do you expect to learn during your studies?</h3>
					<p>I expect to learn a broad range of things from studying IT. </br> 
						The subjects involved in the IT course here at RMIT is all 
						encompassing and should provide me a solid foundation when
						trying to find a job in the industry. </br> I am quite a creative 
						person so if I can find a niche in which I can combine my 
						love of creation and entertainment with technology, I think 
						I’ll be able to achieve some good results.</p>

				<h2>Ideal Job</h2>
			</header>
				<img src="img/myface.jpg">
				
			<p>Above is an ad from seek.com advertising the role of "Digital Media Specialist" at Whizdom</p>
			<p>This position is perfect for a person that has creative flair.
				Being a digital media specialist involves not only graphic design elements, 
				it requires a vast knowledge of online marketing strategies and techniques.
				This role appeals to me because it would utilize my passion for creative
				designs and allow me to evolve my own personal style.</p>
			</section>
		
			<section>
			<p>This position can utilize a myriad of different skillsets. 
				Not only does this role require a keen eye for design, 
				it also plays into a person’s web site development and marketing prowess. 
				In creating media for a company, you need to know what your target demographic 
				is looking for, this requires a great deal of research and market analysis on
				top of the creative aspects of the job.</p>
			</section>
	
			<section>
			<p>I personally believe, although I have no formal training, 
				I have quite a good eye for graphic design. In my past
				I have done stints of professional video editing work
				which would be a great asset for this role, but again, 
				lack of credentials is a setback.</p>
			</section> 

			<section>
			<p>There are a variety of ways I can go about getting relevant qualifications and skills
				required for this role but so far, my career path is relying on my university degrees.
				My double degree in creative industries and IT will greatly enhance my chances at 
				getting a job like this as a university degree in creative industries solidifies my 
				ability in creative roles. This is one area where most struggle as they don’t have
				evidence of their creative ability. IT is also a major step forward with this role 
				as again it shows that I am competent with the digital side of the job. The underlaying 
				skills that come with the job (Graphic design, video editing, creative writing, etc.)
				would be more difficult to bolster. As these things aren’t necessarily covered in depth
				in my studies, they would be skills that will improve over time. With work experience or
				internship these skills can be quickly boosted and added to my resume.</p>

					<h3>Learning style results</h3>
					<p>Auditory = 45% </br> Visual = 30% </br> Tactile = 25% </p>
					<p>"If you are an auditory learner, you learn by hearing and listening.
						You understand and remember things you have heard. You store 
						information by the way it sounds, and you have an easier time 
						understanding spoken instructions than written ones. You often 
						learn by reading out loud because you have to hear it or speak 
						it in order to know it."</p>
