				<h2>So Why IT?</h2>

				<section>
					<h3>What is your background in IT?</h3>
					<p>My interesting in IT has been developing from a love of video games and technology. 
						When I was 11 my parents gave my brother and I an Xbox 360 for Christmas. From 
						that day forward my love of video games blossomed and from that I got into gaming 
						setups and computers. The first day of summer holidays for the next few years I 
						would take the xbox into my room and spend an entire day rigging up my tv, chair, 
						desk, laptop and trying to emulate my favourite youtuber setups. Straight after 
						school I went into a music degree thinking that was what I wanted to do for the 
						rest of my life but after a year, although I loved it, I thought that a degree 
						in music is somewhat pointless. Since then I found a passion for live streaming.
						Although the market is heavily saturated these days, I feel as though the community
						I’ve built over the last 6 months is just the beginning of what I really want to
						achieve in life. Streaming is swiftly enrapturing my heart but, in saying that, 
						ensuring I have career options if/when I can’t chase down the streaming dream is essential. </p>
					<p>First IT job started when I was in my late teens, and have been in IT ever since still bouncing around different areas.</p>

					<h3>Education</h3>
					<p>I've taught at different levels of education.</br>
					Younger primary school students in after school coding programs through Invent the World.</br>
					University level education ranging from 1st year to Post Grad students through RMIT on campus and online via Open University Australia</p>
				</section>
				
				
				<section>
					<h3>Philosophy</h3>
					<p>While there I don't have formal education in philosophy it is very much an interest of mine.</p>
					<p>Always interested in reading and learning more! I can not recommend having another interest enough outside of Information Technology. Such development and passion in other areas can only benefit you more.</p>

				<h2>Ideal Job</h2>
			</header>			  
			<p>Really anything that continues to push me further...</p>
			<p>... But to answer the question I would be looking at a Business Analyst role or Security Consultant in the future.
			I'm very much interested in the security field and business management, so I'd hope to move into one of those areas and continue learning of the many different facets of IT.
			While interested in transitioning into one of those fields, I would hope to have time available to allow for me to stay within the education sector.</p>
